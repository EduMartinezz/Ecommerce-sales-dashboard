# Real-Time E-Commerce Sales Dashboard with Predictive Analytics

## Overview
The **Real-Time E-Commerce Sales Dashboard** is an interactive web application built with Streamlit to monitor e-commerce sales metrics, analyze customer behavior, and forecast future sales. It leverages the Online Retail Dataset, with dates shifted from 2010–2012 to 2024–2025 to simulate real-time data. The dashboard provides real-time metrics (revenue, order volume, average order value), historical sales trends, and predictive analytics using ARIMA and Prophet models.

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end solution, combining data analytics, data science, and data engineering skills, making it highly relevant for e-commerce, retail, and tech industries.

## Features
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Displays revenue, order volume, and average order value for the selected period, with period-over-period deltas (e.g., last 7 days vs. previous 7 days).
- **Interactive Filters**: Filter by date range, country, forecast period (7 to 60 days), and metrics period (1 to 30 days).
- **Sales Trend & Forecasts Plot**: Visualizes actual sales, a 7-day moving average, ARIMA (orange) and Prophet (blue) forecasts, with toggleable 95% confidence intervals.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates RMSE for ARIMA and Prophet forecasts to evaluate accuracy.
- **Downloads**: Export the sales trend plot as HTML (`sales_forecast.html`) and forecast data as CSV (`forecast_data.csv`).
- **Debug Info**: Provides detailed statistics (e.g., date ranges, NaN counts, forecast stats) for troubleshooting.

## Why This Project?
- **Relevance**: E-commerce sales optimization is a critical business problem, valued by companies like Amazon, Shopify, and Walmart.
- **Skill Diversity**: Showcases data analytics (dashboards, EDA), data science (time series forecasting with ARIMA and Prophet), and data engineering (real-time data processing, deployment).
- **Scalability**: Simulates real-time data pipelines, with potential for expansion using Apache Spark or cloud deployment.
- **Portfolio Impact**: An interactive, deployed dashboard with predictive analytics highlights depth in analytics, science, and engineering.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jihyeseo/online-retail-data-set-from-uci-ml-repo) from Kaggle (originally from UCI ML Repository).
- **Details**: Contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer (invoices, products, quantities, prices, timestamps).
- **Preprocessing**: Dates shifted to 2024–2025 to simulate real-time data. Cleaned data saved as `cleaned_data.csv`.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**: Check with `python --version`.
- **pip**: For installing dependencies.
- **ngrok**: For public access ([ngrok.io](https://ngrok.com/download)).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ecommerce-sales-dashboard.git
   cd ecommerce-sales-dashboard

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set Up ngrok**:
Download and install ngrok.
Add your auth token:  ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN

5. **Ensure Data Files**:
Place cleaned_data.csv, arima_forecast.csv, and prophet_forecast.csv in the root directory.


## Usage
1. **Run locally**
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
   
2. **Run with ngrok**
   streamlit run dashboard.py --server.port 8501
   ngrok http 8501
   Use the ngrok URL (e.g., https://<random-id>.ngrok.io) to access the dashboard publicly.

3.**Interact with the Dashboard**
  Use the sidebar to filter by date range, country, forecast period, and metrics period.
  Toggle ARIMA/Prophet forecasts and confidence intervals.
  Download the plot as HTML (sales_forecast.html) or data as CSV (forecast_data.csv).

## Testing
- Verify the plot shows data up to 2025-04-04 with a 30-day forecast.

- Check "Debug Info" for correct dates (e.g., last actual date: 2025-04-04) and non-identical RMSE   values.

- Download sales_forecast.html and forecast_data.csv to confirm they open correctly.

## Troubleshooting
- Missing Files: Ensure cleaned_data.csv, arima_forecast.csv, and prophet_forecast.csv are in the    root directory.
- Plot Issues: Adjust the date range in filters or check "Debug Info" for NaN values
- ngrok Errors: Verify your token and internet connection.


## Future Improvements
- Tune ARIMA/Prophet models for better accuracy (e.g., hyperparameter optimization).

- Add product category analysis and customer segmentation.

- Implement real-time data streaming with Apache Spark or Kafka.

- Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud for persistent access.
